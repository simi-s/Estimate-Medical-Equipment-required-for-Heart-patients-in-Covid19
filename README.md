# Estimate-Medical-Equipment-required-for-Heart-patients-in-Covid19

## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to find the number of medical equipments required by each state in Covid19 environment. For this project we will specifically focus on heart disease and calculating the number of heart disease equipments required by health care providers. This estimation will be useful for healthcare providers and Government officials to estimate and prioritize the purchase of cardiac equipment in Covid-19 situation. Source of this dataset is from the National Cardiovascular disease surveillance data. For this project we will be concentrating specifically on Cardiovascular diseases. Although, this model can be replicated for any other diseases during a pandemic.
This particular dataset consist of data from all the states in USA from the timeframe 2011 to 2017. The 2020 data has not been published yet but we will predict it using the Linear regression model. We will also be clustering the state wise data using K-Mean clustering, so that we can prioritize the states which are at a higher risk and therefore require more medical equipment relative to other states.
### Goal
The main purpose of this project is to filter and analyze the estimated percentage of prevalence of heart
